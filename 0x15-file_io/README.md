C - File I/O
This project is about learning how to work with files in the C programming language using system calls. By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts:

How to create, open, close, read and write files
What file descriptors are and how to use them
The purpose and names of the 3 standard file descriptors in POSIX systems
How to use the open, close, read and write system calls
What the O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY and O_RDWR flags mean
How to set file permissions when creating a file with the open system call
What system calls are and how they differ from functions
To complete the project, you must solve the tasks without plagiarizing someone else's work. You are only allowed to use certain editors, libraries and syscalls, and your code should follow certain guidelines.

Here are the project requirements:

Use one of the allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
Compile your code on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with certain options
End all files with a new line
Include a README.md file in the project's root folder
Use the Betty style for your code, which will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
Do not use global variables
Use no more than 5 functions per file
Only use the malloc, free and exit functions from the C standard library
Only use certain syscalls: read, write, open, close
Include prototypes for all functions and the _putchar function in a header file called main.h
Guard all header files against multiple inclusion
Prefer using symbolic constants over numbers when it makes sense
Show output in Markdown format only in codeblocks and no plain text
Use English language for the output
